# Part1: The Basics - Introduction to C# Programming
An introductory exercise for absolute beginners to understand how C# works using Visual Studio. This project demonstrates:

- Top-level statements in C# (C# 9 and above)
- Namespaces and class structures
- The `Main()` method as the program's entry point
- Console input/output
- Basic data types and variables
- Type conversions (implicit and explicit)
- String formatting and concatenation
- Arithmetic and logical operators

---

## Project Structure
- File1: Program.cs => Variables, input/output
- File2: CastingDemo.cs => Type casting and conversion
- File3: ControlFlow.cs => Conditional logic: if, else

## How to Run the Project
- Open Visual Studio 2022, for sure :-)
- Open the "Part01Basics" folder as a project (or any other name based on your project name).
- Make sure that the .cs file that is also open if you want to read and review the code before running.
- Press Ctrl + F5 to run without debugging, or F5 to run with debugging. Or, you can also use the green arrows as explained in the lectures.
- Follow the console prompts to enter/input your info.
